# Python Scripts Portfolio

## Project 1: Data Analysis Tool

### Overview
An automated data processing and visualization script designed for business intelligence. This tool extracts data from multiple sources, performs complex analysis, and generates comprehensive visual reports.

### Features
- Multi-source data extraction (CSV, Excel, SQL databases, APIs)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and trend identification
- Automated report generation
- Interactive visualizations
- Scheduled execution and email delivery
- Customizable parameters and filters
- Export to multiple formats (PDF, Excel, HTML)

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for predictive analytics
- SQLAlchemy for database connections
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development

### Implementation Details
The Data Analysis Tool was developed to streamline the business intelligence process for a retail company. The script connects to various data sources including the company's SQL database, third-party APIs, and locally stored Excel files.

The data processing pipeline includes cleaning steps to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Advanced statistical methods are applied to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies in sales data.

The reporting module automatically generates visually appealing charts and tables, organized into a comprehensive dashboard. The tool is scheduled to run weekly, delivering fresh insights directly to stakeholders' inboxes.

### Results
- Reduced analysis time from 2 days to 30 minutes
- Identified previously undetected sales patterns
- Improved inventory management decisions
- Enabled data-driven marketing strategies

## Project 2: Web Scraping Automation

### Overview
A robust web scraping system that extracts, processes, and stores data from multiple websites. The script navigates complex web structures, handles authentication, and processes data at scale.

### Features
- Multi-site scraping with configurable targets
- Proxy rotation and user agent switching
- CAPTCHA handling
- Rate limiting to respect website policies
- Data extraction from HTML, JavaScript, and AJAX content
- Structured data storage
- Incremental updates
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Beautiful Soup and Selenium for scraping
- Requests and aiohttp for HTTP requests
- MongoDB for data storage
- Proxies and VPN integration
- Docker for containerization
- Airflow for scheduling

### Implementation Details
The Web Scraping Automation script was built for a market research company needing to monitor competitor pricing and product information. The system uses a combination of Beautiful Soup for static content and Selenium for JavaScript-heavy pages.

To avoid detection and blocking, the script implements sophisticated request patterns with rotating proxies, randomized user agents, and natural browsing behavior simulation. CAPTCHA challenges are handled through a combination of automated solvers and human-in-the-loop processing for complex cases.

The extracted data is cleaned, normalized, and stored in MongoDB with a schema designed for efficient querying. The system runs daily incremental updates, only processing new or changed content to minimize resource usage.

### Results
- Collected data from 50+ websites with 99.7% accuracy
- Enabled real-time competitive analysis
- Reduced manual research costs by 80%
- Provided actionable insights for pricing strategy

## Project 3: Automated File Processing System

### Overview
A file processing automation script that handles document conversion, data extraction, and workflow integration. The system processes various file formats, extracts relevant information, and triggers appropriate actions.

### Features
- Support for multiple file formats (PDF, Word, Excel, images)
- OCR for text extraction from images and scanned documents
- Form field recognition and data extraction
- Document classification using machine learning
- Metadata extraction and indexing
- Batch processing capabilities
- Integration with existing workflows and systems
- Comprehensive logging and error reporting

### Technologies Used
- Python
- PyPDF2 and pdfminer for PDF processing
- Tesseract OCR for text recognition
- OpenCV for image processing
- NLTK for text analysis
- TensorFlow for document classification
- RabbitMQ for task queuing
- RESTful APIs for system integration

### Implementation Details
The Automated File Processing System was developed for a legal firm to streamline document handling. The script monitors designated folders for new files, automatically detecting the document type and extracting relevant information.

For scanned documents, the system applies OCR with custom post-processing to improve accuracy for legal terminology. Machine learning models classify documents into categories (contracts, court filings, correspondence, etc.) with 95% accuracy.

Extracted data is validated against business rules and integrated with the firm's case management system through API calls. The entire process is monitored with comprehensive logging and error handling, with alerts for any documents requiring manual review.

### Results
- Processed over 10,000 documents monthly
- Reduced document processing time from hours to minutes
- Decreased manual data entry errors by 95%
- Improved document searchability and accessibility
